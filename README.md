This is where your description should go. Limit it to a paragraph or two. Consider adding a small example.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require syriable/filament-utilities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not set up a custom theme and are using Filament Panels follow the instructions in the [Filament Docs](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/styling/overview#creating-a-custom-theme) first.

After setting up a custom theme add the plugin's views to your theme css file or your app's css file if using the standalone packages.

```css
@source '../../../../vendor/syriable/filament-utilities/resources/**/*.blade.php';
```

php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-utilities-migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-utilities-config"
```

Optionally, you can publish the views using

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="filament-utilities-views"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:
